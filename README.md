# Time Tracker
This is a simple app I created to play with React.  At the time, my wife worked multiple shifts a day on a dairy farm.  It was time consuming to calculate her hours every week since it varied so greatly, so enter this app to help.  It's not elegant by any means, but it was a great learning experience and served a purpose!
